Currently, development on Atheos is going very FrontEnd heavy. I think the more familiar I get with the FrontEnd, the more I want to work on it; as such, the PHP BackEnd is probably going to suffer; luckily the BackEnd was originally developed by (at least as far as I have seen so far) very talented and foreword thinking individuals. The BackEnd has never caused a single issue for as long as I have been using Atheos/Codiad. Honestly, the FrontEnd was incredibly stable, and I'd like to think that I've only made it more stable and more responsive.  
Most of my time is split between working on the Infrastructure and the FrontEnd, constantly hopping back and forth between them. While some may see this as ineffiecent, I actually get a lot more work done. It allows me to take breaks and stay fresh while continuing to work on things.
