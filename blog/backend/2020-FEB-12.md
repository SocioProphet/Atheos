I use console.log() in JS probably too much in regards to debugging, but it's really easy to use and provides exactly what I need to know. PHP doesn't have a console.log() function, I mean it does, error\_log, but it's not as easy to use. This is honestly the main hang-up I'm having in getting close to the BackEnd. I recently had cause to play around with Node.jS and it is very tempting (probably impossible in a reasonable time-frame) to try to recreate the entire backend in Node, but let's be real; that's not going to happen. At least not for a long time.  
I have made a few forrays into the backend, but I'm always left with a feeling akin to a fool's errand. There's nothing for me to do, nothing calls out to me. What really causes me concern is I can't tell if that's because the code meets standards (Codacy disagrees), or because I'm not familiar enough with PHP. I have made a good number of project in PHP, but I'm self taught on everything I know. I have zero formal education in programming aside from High School. If anyone knows of a good starting place within Atheos, let me know.
