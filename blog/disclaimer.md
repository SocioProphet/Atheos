> This written by Liam Siira, as a place to keep those interested in Atheos in the know as to what direction Atheos is going in. This is intended to be a more personal dialog from me to whoever decides to read this, and should be taken as such, and not as an official announcement from some powerful organization with a PR team. It's from me, Liam, to you, the reader, with nothing but positive intentions and hopefully useful information.
