  "body": "# Atheos Web IDE\r\n\r\nAtheos is a web-based IDE framework with a small footprint and minimal requirements. The system is still early in development, and while it has been proven extremely stable please be sure to backup regularly if you use it in any production work.\r\n\r\nKeep up to date with the latest changes and news on **[Twitter](http://twitter.com/Atheoside)** or **[Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/Atheos)**\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\nInstallation of Atheos requires uploading the files and making several directories and a config file writeable. There is no database and no other server components are required. PHP 5.3 or above is recommended, however, the system will work with any version of PHP over v.5.\r\n\r\nFor more information please **[read the installation instructions](https://github.com/Fluidbyte/Atheos/wiki/Installation)** on the Wiki.\r\n\r\n## Interface\r\n\r\nAtheos consists of three panels; a left panel which houses the file manager and active files, center panel which is where editors reside, and a right panel which contains system and other controls. The right side panel collapses and there's no top toolbar to provide maximum real-estate to the editor.\r\n\r\n![Atheos Screenshot](http://Atheos.com/screenshot.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Getting More Advanced\r\n\r\nAtheos is a very complete package, however, it was designed to allow developers to easily expand upon the base platform.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking to develop components or custom functionality please **[check out the Wiki](https://github.com/Fluidbyte/Atheos/wiki)** for information about the architecture and API.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
