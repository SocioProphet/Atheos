### Manual Upgrade Guide

To upgrade simply delete everything except the following or move these folders to a new directory:

    /config.php
    /data
    /workspace
    /plugins
    /themes
    
Navigate to ```/themes``` and delete the ```default``` folder. Download the neweset verson from the Github repo and extract its content to the root directory of your Atheos installation.

Ensure that the files and folder mentioned above still have write capabilities.
